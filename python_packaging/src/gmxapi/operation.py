"""Define gmxapi-compliant Operations

Provide decorators and base classes to generate and validate gmxapi Operations.

Nodes in a work graph are created as instances of Operations. An Operation factory
accepts well-defined inputs as key word arguments. The object returned by such
a factory is a handle to the node in the work graph. It's ``output`` attribute
is a collection of the Operation's results.

function_wrapper(...) produces a wrapper that converts a function to an Operation
factory. The Operation is defined when the wrapper is called. The Operation is
instantiated when the factory is called. The function is executed when the Operation
instance is run.

The framework ensures that an Operation instance is executed no more than once.

    A DataEdge connects a data source collection to a data sink. A sink is an
    input or collection of inputs of an operation (or fused operation). An operation's
    inputs may be fed from multiple data source collections, but an operation
    cannot be fully instantiated until all of its inputs are bound, so the DataEdge
    is instantiated at the same time the operation is instantiated because the
    required topology of a graph edge may be determined by the required topology
    of another graph edge.

    A data edge has a well-defined topology only when it is terminated by both
    a source and sink. Creation requires that a source collection is compared to
    a sink description.

    Calling code initiates edge creation by passing well-described data sources
    to an operation factory. The data sources may be annotated with explicit scatter
    or gather commands.

    The resource manager for the new operation determines the
    required shape of the sink to handle all of the offered input.

    Broadcasting
    and transformations of the data sources are then determined and the edge is
    established.

    At that point, the fingerprint of the input data at each operation
    becomes available to the resource manager for the operation. The fingerprint
    has sufficient information for the resource manager of the operation to
    request and receive data through the execution context.

    Instantiating operations and data edges implicitly involves collaboration with
    a Context instance. The state of a given Context or the availability of a
    default Context through a module function may affect the ability to instantiate
    an operation or edge. In other words, behavior may be different for connections
    being made in the scripting environment versus the running Session, and implementation
    details can determine whether or not new operations or data flow can occur in
    different code environments.

class ResourceManager(SourceResource):
    """Provides data publication and subscription services.

        Owns the data published by the operation implementation or served to consumers.
        Mediates read and write access to the managed data streams.

        This ResourceManager implementation is defined in conjunction with a
        run-time definition of an Operation that wraps a Python callable (function).
        ResourceManager is instantiated with a reference to the callable.

        When the Operation is run, the resource manager prepares resources for the wrapped
        function. Inputs provided to the Operation factory are provided to the
        function as keyword arguments. The wrapped function publishes its output
        through the (additional) ``output`` key word argument. This argument is
        a short-lived resource, prepared by the ResourceManager, with writable
        attributes named in the call to function_wrapper().

        After the Operation has run and the outputs published, the data managed
        by the ResourceManager is marked "done."

        Protocols:

        The data() method produces a read-only collection of outputs named for
        the Operation when the Operation's ``output`` attribute is accessed.

        publishing_resources() can be called once during the ResourceManager lifetime
        to provide the ``output`` object for the wrapped function. (Used by update_output().)

        update_output() brings the managed output data up-to-date with the input
        when the Operation results are needed. If the Operation has not run, an
        execution session is prepared with input and output arguments for the
        wrapped Python callable. Output is publishable only during this session.

    TODO: This functionality should evolve to be a facet of Context implementations.
     There should be no more than one ResourceManager instance per work graph
     node in a Context. This will soon be at odds with letting the ResourceManager
     be owned by an operation instance handle.
    TODO: The publisher and data objects can be more strongly defined through
     interaction between the Context and clients.

    Design notes:

    The normative pattern for updating data is to execute a node in the work
    graph, passing Resources for an execution Session to an operation runner.
    The resources and runner are dependent on the implementation details of
    the operation and the execution context, so logical execution may look
    like the following.

        resource_builder = ResourcesBuilder()
        runner_builder = RunnerBuilder()
        input_resource_director = input_resource_factory.director(input)
        output_resource_director = publishing_resource_factory.director(output)
        input_resource_director(resource_builder, runner_builder)
        output_resource_director(resource_builder, runner_builder)
        resources = resource_builder.build()
        runner = runner_builder.build()
        runner(resources)

    Only the final line is intended to be literal. The preceding code, if it
    exists in entirety, may be spread across several code comments.

    TODO: Data should be pushed, not pulled.
    Early implementations executed operation code and extracted results directly.
    While we need to be able to "wait for" results and alert the data provider that
    we are ready for input, we want to defer execution management and data flow to
    the framework.

    When subclassing from Subgraph, aspects of the subgraph's data ports can be
    specified with keyword arguments in the class statement. Example::

        >>> class MySubgraph(Subgraph, variables={'int_with_default': 1, 'boolData': bool}): pass
        ...

    Keyword Args:
        variables: Mapping to declare the types of variables with optional default values.

    Execution model:
        Subgraph execution must follow a well-defined protocol in order to sensibly
        resolve data Futures at predictable points. Note that subgraphs act as operations
        that can be automatically redefined at run time (in limited cases), such as
        to automatically form iteration chains to implement "while" loops. We refer
        to one copy / iteration / generation of a subgraph as an "element" below.

        When a subgraph element begins execution, each of its variables with an
        "updated" state from the previous iteration has the "updated" state moved
        to the new element's "initial" state, and the "updated" state is voided.

        Subgraph.next() appends an element of the subgraph to the chain. Subsequent
        calls to Subgraph.run() bring the new outputs up to date (and then call next()).
        Thus, for a subgraph with an output called ``is_converged``, calling
        ``while (not subgraph.is_converged): subgraph.run()`` has the desired effect,
        but is likely suboptimal for execution. Instead use the gmxapi while_loop.

        If the subgraph is not currently executing, it can be in one of two states:
        "editing" or "ready". In the "ready" state, class and instance Variables
        cannot be assigned, but can be read through the data descriptors. In this
        state, the descriptors only have a single state.

        If "editing," variables on the class object can be assigned to update the
        data flow defined for the subgraph. While "editing", reading or writing
        instance Variables is undefined behavior.

        When "editing" begins, each variable is readable as a proxy to the "initial"
        state in an element. Assignments while "editing" put variables in temporary
        states accessible only during editing.
        When "editing" finishes, the "updated" output data source of each
        variable for the element is set, if appropriate.

    Returns and operation instance that acts like a single node in the current
    work graph, but which is a proxy to the operation at the end of a dynamically generated chain
    of operations. At run time, condition is evaluated for the last element in
    the current chain. If condition evaluates False, the chain is extended and
    the next element is executed. When condition evaluates True, the object
    returned by ``while_loop`` becomes a proxy for the last element in the chain.

    Equivalent to calling operation.while(condition), where available.

    Arguments:
        operation: a callable that produces an instance of an operation when called with no arguments.
        condition: a callable that accepts an object (returned by ``operation``) that returns a boolean.

    Warning:
        The protocol by which ``while_loop`` interacts with ``operation`` and ``condition``
        is very unstable right now. Please refer to this documentation when installing new
        versions of the package.

    Protocol:
        Warning:
            This protocol will be changed before the 0.1 API is finalized.

        When called, ``while_loop`` calls ``operation`` without arguments
        and captures the return value captured as ``_operation``.
        The object produced by ``operation()`` must have a ``reset``,
        a ``run`` method, and an ``output`` attribute.

        This is inspected
        to determine the output data proxy for the operation produced by the call
        to ``while_loop``. When that operation is called, it does the equivalent of

            while(condition(self._operation)):
                self._operation.reset()
                self._operation.run()

        self._operation.output.
