"""Define gmxapi-compliant Operations

Provide decorators and base classes to generate and validate gmxapi Operations.

Nodes in a work graph are created as instances of Operations. An Operation factory
accepts well-defined inputs as key word arguments. The object returned by such
a factory is a handle to the node in the work graph. It's ``output`` attribute
is a collection of the Operation's results.

function_wrapper(...) produces a wrapper that converts a function to an Operation
factory. The Operation is defined when the wrapper is called. The Operation is
instantiated when the factory is called. The function is executed when the Operation
instance is run.

The framework ensures that an Operation instance is executed no more than once.

    A class deriving from DataProxyBase allows its instances to provide a namespace
    for proxies to named data by defining attributes that are data descriptors
    (subclasses of ProxyDataDescriptor).

    Acts as an owning handle to the resources provide by ``instance``,
    preventing the reference count of ``instance`` from going to zero for the
    lifetime of the proxy object.

    to the ``descriptors`` key word argument in the class declaration. This
    allows data proxy subclasses to be easily defined dynamically.

class DataEdge(object):
    """State and description of a data flow edge.

    A DataEdge connects a data source collection to a data sink. A sink is an
    input or collection of inputs of an operation (or fused operation). An operation's
    inputs may be fed from multiple data source collections, but an operation
    cannot be fully instantiated until all of its inputs are bound, so the DataEdge
    is instantiated at the same time the operation is instantiated because the
    required topology of a graph edge may be determined by the required topology
    of another graph edge.

    A data edge has a well-defined topology only when it is terminated by both
    a source and sink. Creation requires that a source collection is compared to
    a sink description.

    Calling code initiates edge creation by passing well-described data sources
    to an operation factory. The data sources may be annotated with explicit scatter
    or gather commands.

    The resource manager for the new operation determines the
    required shape of the sink to handle all of the offered input.

    Broadcasting
    and transformations of the data sources are then determined and the edge is
    established.

    At that point, the fingerprint of the input data at each operation
    becomes available to the resource manager for the operation. The fingerprint
    has sufficient information for the resource manager of the operation to
    request and receive data through the execution context.

    Instantiating operations and data edges implicitly involves collaboration with
    a Context instance. The state of a given Context or the availability of a
    default Context through a module function may affect the ability to instantiate
    an operation or edge. In other words, behavior may be different for connections
    being made in the scripting environment versus the running Session, and implementation
    details can determine whether or not new operations or data flow can occur in
    different code environments.

class ResourceManager(object):

        Owns the data published by the operation implementation or served to consumers.
        Mediates read and write access to the managed data streams.

        This ResourceManager implementation is defined in conjunction with a
        run-time definition of an Operation that wraps a Python callable (function).
        ResourceManager is instantiated with a reference to the callable.

        When the Operation is run, the resource manager prepares resources for the wrapped
        function. Inputs provided to the Operation factory are provided to the
        function as keyword arguments. The wrapped function publishes its output
        through the (additional) ``output`` key word argument. This argument is
        a short-lived resource, prepared by the ResourceManager, with writable
        attributes named in the call to function_wrapper().

        After the Operation has run and the outputs published, the data managed
        by the ResourceManager is marked "done."

        Protocols:

        The data() method produces a read-only collection of outputs named for
        the Operation when the Operation's ``output`` attribute is accessed.

        publishing_resources() can be called once during the ResourceManager lifetime
        to provide the ``output`` object for the wrapped function. (Used by update_output().)

        update_output() brings the managed output data up-to-date with the input
        when the Operation results are needed. If the Operation has not run, an
        execution session is prepared with input and output arguments for the
        wrapped Python callable. Output is publishable only during this session.

    TODO: This functionality should evolve to be a facet of Context implementations.
     There should be no more than one ResourceManager instance per work graph
     node in a Context. This will soon be at odds with letting the ResourceManager
     be owned by an operation instance handle.
    TODO: The publisher and data objects can be more strongly defined through
     interaction between the Context and clients.

    Design notes:

    The normative pattern for updating data is to execute a node in the work
    graph, passing Resources for an execution Session to an operation runner.
    The resources and runner are dependent on the implementation details of
    the operation and the execution context, so logical execution may look
    like the following.

        resource_builder = ResourcesBuilder()
        runner_builder = RunnerBuilder()
        input_resource_director = input_resource_factory.director(input)
        output_resource_director = publishing_resource_factory.director(output)
        input_resource_director(resource_builder, runner_builder)
        output_resource_director(resource_builder, runner_builder)
        resources = resource_builder.build()
        runner = runner_builder.build()
        runner(resources)

    Only the final line is intended to be literal. The preceding code, if it
    exists in entirety, may be spread across several code comments.

    TODO: Data should be pushed, not pulled.
    Early implementations executed operation code and extracted results directly.
    While we need to be able to "wait for" results and alert the data provider that
    we are ready for input, we want to defer execution management and data flow to
    the framework.
