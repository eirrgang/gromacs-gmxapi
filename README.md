This is a fork of the main Gromacs project in which interface, API, and extensibility issues are being investigated.
This README.md file supplants the main README file to avoid merge conflicts while providing convenient documentation to the BitBucket repository browser.
The usual Gromacs README is still here without the .md file extension.

    git clone 
    cmake ../../develop/gromacs-public/ -DGMX_API=ON
    make

Then open `src/api/docs/html/index.html`

Please use the Bitbucket issue tracking system and other features to make comments, feature requests,
pull requests, etcetera, or email M. Eric Irrgang.

Please note this repository is in migration and will rapidly evolve over the week or two following the 2017 summer Gromacs workshop at MPI.
